# AbeChat

## Projects

This directory is the top level directory of all of AbeChat. Each child directory
should correspond to an individual project that is part of the overall AbeChat project.

As an example, if you wanted to create a native desktop client application, that
would be in a new directory along side AbeChatServer, maybe like AbeChatNativeClient
or something.

### AbeChatServer
The `AbeChatServer` directory contains the code for the service side of AbeChat.
This will be the middle man between clients that manages users and their interactions
with each other.
